///// Objectives from assignment doc
// You will create a small single-page web application.
// Use DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience.
// Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to facilitate creation of a dynamic web application.
// Demonstrate profi ciency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
// Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.

//////// WHAT I KNOW:
// Its supposed to be a single page website
// Combine topics of HTML/CSS and Javascript/DOM/BOM

// GOAL: i am gonna create a single page application for GadgetShack, my tech ecommerce website that i created for SBA 307.
// GOAL: This page for my ecommerce website, GadgetShack, will be a registration form, where user can enter their username, email and password
// GOAL: This page should not reload, but content should change.
// GOAL: Make sure it satisfy all the DOM/BOM/Validation requirement mentioned in the doc, --> that will be in my script.
// GOAL: Focus more on User experience: Since its a single page, maybe focus more of styling, it should look good

// Things to keep in mind:
// 1. Use DOM methods (createElement, appendChild)
// 2. Validate forms (dont let empty password submit)
// 3. Make it look good (use SBA 307 styles)
// 4. Use BOM properties (window, alert)

// Remember (from dylan/lecture):
// 1. Get elements first using querySelector or getElementById.
// 2. Use Event Listeners (click, submit, etc).
// 3. Prevent default form submission behavior.
// 4. Use DOM properties to modify the page (innerHTML, style, classList).
// 5. Use BOM properties.
